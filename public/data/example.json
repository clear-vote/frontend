From her days as a prosecutor to her service as Vice President, she has defended the rights of everyday people by standing up to predators, scammers, and powerful interests. She has been fearless in taking on anyone who threatens the rights and freedoms of Americans. As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars, standing up for women and children. As California Attorney General, she cracked down on transnational gangs trafficking drugs and guns across the border to make communities safer. She also took on the big banks that committed mortgage fraud, winning back billions in relief for homeowners. As a Senator and Vice President, she took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors and led the fight for reproductive freedom. She has also advanced America’s interests on the world stage, including by taking on Russian leader Vladimir Putin and standing with NATO. As president, she would make strengthening the middle class a defining goal of her presidency. She will confront price gouging, work to lower costs, and expand opportunity so that every American has the chance to not just get by, but get ahead. And she will continue fighting to restore our freedoms, from reproductive rights to voting rights. Governor Tim Walz is a champion for working families. He served 24 years in the Army National Guard. After attending college thanks to the GI Bill, Walz was a high school teacher and football coach – taking his team to the state championship for the first time in the school’s history. He was a member of Congress in a Republican-leaning district, with a record of bipartisanship. As Governor, Walz cut taxes for working families, lowered the cost of insulin, and protected women’s right to choose. Kamala D. President",

If you have a child today, your son or daughter will have a shorter lifespan than you. This is what happens when you keep voting for the “lesser of evils” thinking one of the evils will “save you. ” They have no interest in saving you, except killing you. The Solution - The truth is you must want to Save Yourself! We need a systems overhaul , which demands a bottoms-up movement by we the people, done by us, and for us. Shiva 4 President - When you vote for Shiva 4 President, you are acknowledging that the “Swarm” and its puppets are out to enslave you. You acknowledge that the only solution is Us, electing one of Us to be our leader. The Swarm imposes their leaders on us. None of the alternatives are one of Us. Dr. Shiva is one of Us. He came bottoms-up, escaping the degenerate and oppressive caste system of India. As a 14-year-old, he created the world’s first email system, being awarded the first U. S. Copyright for Email, recognizing him as the legal and official inventor of email. He went on to receive four degrees at MIT, and started 7 successful companies, never taking any venture financing from the elites in Silicon Valley. Dr. Shiva has a history of delivering real solutions to transform the lives of everyday people. Shatter The Swarm: The movement for Truth Freedom Health® and Shiva 4 President offers you the opportunity to Shatter The Swarm to win the life we need and deserve. Vote Shiva 4 President.

With Vice President nominee JD Vance, our mission is stronger than ever. Donald J. Trump will stand up to the radical left that seeks to weaken our nation. He is dedicated to strengthening our borders to stop illegal immigration and ensuring that we put America First. The current administration's failures have led to runaway inflation, crippling the economy and burdening hardworking families. Donald J. Trump will implement policies to bring down inflation, create better trade deals, and prioritize American jobs and industries. Donald J. Trump believes in a strong and prosperous America. He will restore economic stability, secure our borders, and make America a leader on the world stage again. The threats we face from adversaries abroad, like China and other foreign powers, will be met with decisive action to protect our nation's interests. Our movement to Make America Great Again is the only force that can bring safety, prosperity, and peace back to our country.

Kennedy Jr. is running for president as an independent to end the corrupt merger between corporations and government and fix the broken two party system that has undermined the American way of life. Kennedy proposes a “unity government” in which all parties are represented. Nicole Shanahan joined the ticket to bring power back to the people. As president, Kennedy will end the foreign wars, reign in the military industrial complex and reinvest the trillions saved at home to restore the middle class. He has plans to: 1) redirect 20% of government contracts away from megacorporations that offshore our economy and into small businesses, creating millions of jobs and an economic boom; 2) offer a new GI Bill to anyone willing to serve their community in our domestic Peace Corps, providing corps members with enough life-changing assets to pay their way through college, put a downpayment on a home, or start a small business; 3) assist homebuyers with government-guaranteed 3% mortgages; and 4) cap childcare at 10% of income, so families can achieve the American dream of homeownership and affordable parenthood. As vice president, Shanahan will work with President Kennedy to solve the chronic disease epidemic, protect our children and secure medical freedom. Kennedy and Shanahan will champion regenerative agriculture. By promoting farming practices that restore soil health and enhance biodiversity, they will advance a resilient food system, benefitting people and the planet. Kennedy and Shanahan will secure the southern border and end the migrant crisis that undermines our city budgets. They will address the epidemic of drug addiction and protect reproductive rights. Restoring honest governance, Kennedy and Shanahan will eradicate corruption and ensure transparency and accountability. They will give the American people a voice in guiding legislation through direct democracy initiatives. #AmericaStrong Robert F. Kennedy Jr. President",

Both are abandoning working people, worsening the climate crisis, undermining democracy, and squandering trillions on the endless war machine while tens of millions of Americans lack housing, food, healthcare and more. Over 60% of us now say the two-party system has failed and we need a party that serves the people. I’m running for President to offer that choice for the people. Our campaign is the only anti-war, anti-genocide, pro-worker, climate action choice with a path to the White House. Political insiders smear voters who want better choices. But without freedom of choice in elections, there is no democracy. So forget the elites who tell you to ignore your struggle and to keep voting for the politicians who caused it. Change won't come from them; it has to come from the people. If we come together, we can create an economy that works for all of us with living-wage jobs, healthcare, housing, food, childcare, debt-free education, and guaranteed livable income as human rights. We can create a Green New Deal with millions of jobs to fight climate collapse, secure clean air, water, and food, and protect Mother Earth. We can end endless war, rampant militarism, and genocide, and launch a new foreign policy based on diplomacy, international law, and human rights. We can revive our democracy with ranked-choice voting, proportional representation, and public campaign financing to get big money out of politics. We can end mass incarceration, fix our immigration system, and ensure our rights, freedoms, and justice for all. We have the power to do all this and more - and we can use it in 2024 to start building an America and a world that works for all of us. Jill Stein President",

The capitalist government has no answers to these crises, and is in fact driving them forward, acting as a servant for the Big Banks, Big Tech, Big Oil and the Military-Industrial Complex. In every crisis that the people face, whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires or pandemics, the government has proven itself to be totally inept and to only care about profit. They can’t steer us away from crises — they are part of them. Most people in the country are living paycheck to paycheck, the cost of everything has skyrocketed, and the ten richest men have doubled their fortunes. But both major, pro-capitalist parties are saying that nothing can be done — that this is just how the economy works. We disagree! The resources exist to resolve the problems humanity faces. The only things that stand in the way are the politicians that manage affairs for the billionaires who generate super-profits from workers all over the globe. We stand for socialism — a system where poor and working people hold political and economic power and use it to meet the needs of all people and to preserve the planet. Every gain working people have attained has been through organized struggle and mass movements. We are part of building a movement of working class people committed to eradicating the dictatorship of the billionaires, and building the future we deserve. Join the movement, vote socialist 2024!

Working people are facing the devastating effects of high prices, lack of good paying jobs, unsafe working conditions and schedules that often make political, family, social and union life impossible. Life expectancy is at the lowest in a quarter century and the birthrate has been cut in half since 1950. Today workers are in a mood to fight, organizing, and using their unions to defend their lives and livelihoods. We need to fight for a public works program to put millions to work at union scale wages, for wages and cost of living increases to meet price increases, and for workers control of production to guarantee safety on the job and reverse the profit-driven destruction of the environment. We must defend constitutional freedoms won in struggle—freedoms of worship, speech, press, association, the right to bear arms and more. Frame-up attempts to jail and silence political opponents deal a blow to rights working people need. Only the working class of all countries has the capacity to stop imperialism’s march toward fascism and world war by fighting in our common interests. From Vladimir Putin’s murderous invasion of Ukraine to deny its national sovereignty, to Hamas’ October 7 Jew hating pogrom, the U. S. -rulers’ dominated global order since World War II is coming apart. We defend Israel’s right to exist and defend itself as a refuge for the Jews in the face of growing attacks. We need to build a party to unite all workers and exploited producers, based on the unions, that breaks from all collaboration with the ruling class, fights in our class interests, and wages a struggle for workers power.

The Socialist Equality Party declares that the 2024 election is dominated by three critical issues First, the reckless militarism of the Democratic and Republican parties—seeking to secure the global interests of the financial-corporate oligarchy—has brought the United States to the very brink of World War III. The US-NATO war in Ukraine and the genocidal war in Gaza are part of a broader struggle for world domination. Second, democracy in the US is giving way to authoritarianism, in which the Democrats and Republicans are implicated. Political dictatorship is the outcome of unrestrained corporate economic power. Third, social inequality has reached levels unprecedented in modern US history. This country has the highest concentration of billionaires in the world, whose collective wealth stands at a record $5. 2 trillion. The wealth of the 10 richest billionaires exceeds that of the collective wealth of half the US population. The SEP calls for the expropriation of billion-dollar fortunes and massive increase in taxation of seven-figure incomes. Capitalism has failed and must be ended. Socialism is the future.

We’re being dragged down by an institution that is the product of out-of-touch politicians. I have a different vision. Let's protect the environment by cutting subsidies for oil producers, allowing safe nuclear energy, and eliminating crony capitalist protections for polluters. Let's restore justice by ending qualified immunity and prosecution of victimless crimes. Let's revive the American Dream by cutting regulations that increase the cost of home construction by over 25%. Let's empower those saddled with predatory student loans by making them interest-free and dischargeable in bankruptcy. Let's reduce healthcare costs by ending evergreen patents that keep prices of drugs like insulin high. We must balance our budget for future generations. Decades of reckless spending have led to inflation harming every American. Let’s end the wasteful War on Drugs, reform immigration, shrink the surveillance state, and close unnecessary overseas military bases. Both Major Parties support tariffs which are a regressive tax on consumers. Tariffs lead to trade wars, which especially hurt families in Washington State where approximately 40% of jobs depend on international trade. When goods stop crossing borders, armies will. America has long had the moniker ‘leader of the free world. ’ It’s time we earn that distinction by insisting that Peace is the way forward through trade agreements and diplomacy. In all aspects of policy, Libertarians pursue reform with one goal: to empower people, not the government. When did rational ideas become radical ideas? If you’re living your life and not using force, fraud, coercion or theft, your life’s your life, your body’s your body, your business is your business, and your property’s your property; it’s not mine, and it’s certainly not the government’s.

This comprehensive plan, aptly described as a \"revolution of values,\" outlines a series of audacious initiatives designed to confront systemic inequalities and nurture a more equitable society. Key initiatives: An executive order to prioritize homelessness and poverty; radical education reform (including a federal mandate to equalize per-pupil spending across districts) and environmental protection measures (beginning with declaring a climate emergency); bold steps on healthcare access and gender equality (like publishing the Equal Rights Amendment and codifying abortion rights and body autonomy); transformative foreign policy and immigration reform (involving immediately halting all funding and weapons transfer to Israel); concrete actions on racial justice and democratic reform (including financial reparations and land back programs); and prioritization of workers' rights and labor protections (beginning with drafting a Worker’s Bill of Rights).

As your Congresswoman, I've worked to raise wages, lower costs, protect abortion rights, take bold climate action, and invest in affordable housing. As Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair, I introduced legislation for Medicare for All, tuition-free college, housing as a human right, expanding workers’ rights, raising the federal minimum wage to $15, humane immigration reform, and an ultra-millionaire wealth tax. I’ve introduced numerous bills to get money out of politics and to ensure ethics in Congress and our Supreme Court. I played a critical role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the price of insulin at $35 for seniors, empowered Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices, and made the largest climate investment in history. We also passed the first major gun safety law in over 30 years and made historic infrastructure investments. As your Congresswoman, I’ve held over 100 town halls to hear from you and helped thousands of constituents – including veterans and seniors – secure millions in federal benefits. My office has worked hard to secure tens of millions in new federal investments in local initiatives for housing, jobs, and more. I’m proud to represent a district rich in innovation, diversity, and compassion. I have never taken corporate PAC money because I fight for working people, not the wealthy and well-connected. I came to America alone at 16 years old, and have lived in Seattle for over 30 years. I would be deeply honored to have your vote.

Through the American principle of self-governance we must protect our freedoms and the right to choose. The great goal of our Congress is to reach fundamental agreement on emerging issues while nurturing progress toward peace, liberty, and dignity. Division within our government has been causing the decline of our country’s strength, influence, and productivity. We must unite the House and pass important legislation. We need a healthy, nourished population that can afford the growing cost of living. We need an infrastructure that gives us the luxuries of modern life while balancing the growing problems with pollution and waste. Domestic investment and on-shoring of work are needed to renew our core principles and establish a new foundation for American growth. The Arts are a defining element of our culture. In an increasingly technological world, it is possible to lose the self; the Arts offer respite. Arts investment is crucial for a healthy society; one that must in this generation find stability. We need peace internationally. Our country must stand for freedom and democratic ideals, but it must also seek lasting peace and security. We must strive to include all nations in our world order; securing lands, lifting sanctions, and promoting increased trade in traditional and emerging industries. We must use our power for the exercise of compassion and human betterment; applying our ethics that happiness is sought not through greed and indifference but through generosity and gratitude.

Her decisions reflect careful attention to constitutional rights and civil liberties. McCloud’s judicial independence was foreshadowed by her long career as a lawyer, starting as a public defender. She always made time to serve indigent clients, often in the most difficult contests with the government. As a justice, her fairness, hard work, clear writing, and intellect have earned her awards, endorsements, and ten “Exceptionally Well Qualified” ratings from groups with varying points of view across the state. She is endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and community leaders – all of whom believe in the importance of an independent judiciary and the rule of law. Endorsements include 12 current & former Supreme Court justices; 150 judges statewide; National Women’s Political Caucus of Washington; former Attorney General Rob McKenna, current Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell; Northwest Tribal Court Judges Association; Washington State Labor Council; Washington Conservation Action; Washington Education Association PAC; King, Pierce, and Snohomish County Democrats.

They fill our lungs with smoke, destroy old growth and critical habitat, emit tons of carbon, drive up the cost of home insurance and make housing even more unaffordable. And they cause unimaginable heartache for those unfortunate enough to live in their path. I won’t leave our kids a legacy of burning forests and choking smoke. We can and will do better to remove dead and dying trees that serve as fuel, quickly fight fires when they occur, preserve jobs, and protect the lives and livelihoods of communities. I’ll lead our state Department of Natural Resources to withstand political pressures and overcome bureaucratic obstacles so that the brilliant foresters and environmental scientists who work there can do their jobs. Working with Tribes, scientists, landowners, sportsmen, the forest industry and conservation groups, I’ll restore health to Washington’s forests with science-based management practices so our diverse array of species and ecosystems can thrive. And I’ll always preserve recreational access to public land for its owners -- the people of Washington. Please vote Jaime Herrera Beutler for healthy forests and healthy air.",

With the threat of climate change, wildfires, and droughts, running the Department of Natural Resources is a big, complicated job. I have both the experience and values to ensure our public lands support our high quality of life. As Lands Commissioner I’ll bring bold new ideas to the table. I have a plan to protect Washington’s 77,000 acres of critical legacy forests, and to launch a clean energy trust to help our climate and spur rural economic development. I’ll honor tribal rights and restore Puget Sound to protect our iconic salmon and orca. I’m the only candidate in this race not taking contributions from the timber industry. A former Washington Conservation Voters “Legislator of the Year,” I’m the only candidate supported by Washington Conservation Action and the Sierra Club. I invite you to join grassroots conservation leaders, former Lands Commissioner Peter Goldmark, Democrats and elected leaders across Washington in supporting this campaign to protect and enhance our public lands. I ask for your support.",

Misguided activist policies of the Legislature and the Insurance Commissioner have limited choice and made insurance unaffordable. How much businesses pay for insurance has a direct impact on the prices you pay for things, including groceries and even your rent. Add to that a 20% increase in insurance costs, and it’s even harder for seniors on fixed incomes and families to make ends meet. The insurance industry needs reasonable, not burdensome regulations. As a state Senator, I fought for affordable and consumer-driven options that encourage more competition, more choices, and lower costs for consumers. I know what works and it’s not agenda driven regulations that drive up costs without providing better and more affordable care. I’ve experienced firsthand the health insurance challenges faced by my own grandson who has a rare disease. For him it is a life and death struggle. You and your doctor should be determining your health care decisions, not the insurance companies. A Vote for Phil Fortunato will lower costs, provide predictability and availability in Washington's insurance markets, so you can get the insurance protection your family deserves.",

As State Treasurer, Mike refinanced all eligible debt, redirecting over $550 million in Wall Street profits back to the people. Mike implemented a policy prohibiting Washington State Treasurers from investing in corporations that fund their campaigns. His investments earned Washington $1. 8 billion over the next four years to reduce taxpayer burdens. Mike’s local government investment returns are 50 times higher than 2021, sending $3 million more each day to local governments for schools, first responders, and other community needs. Under Mike’s leadership as State Treasurer, Washington now has budget guardrails. U. S. News just ranked our state’s long-term fiscal stability the best in the nation. Our state pensions are one of America’s best funded. Washington maintains a Moody’s AAA-credit rating, the top mark for strong financial management. This makes housing, road, ferry, and school construction more affordable. Mike lowered GET/529 education costs for families, while keeping this important program fully funded. Mike expanded financial education opportunities. He also created an online “Transparency Portal” to show how your public dollars are managed. Endorsed by Washington State Labor Council and Planned Parenthood, Mike will always put working families and retirees first!",

I will strive to make the accounting system transparent and accountable to citizens. With my professional expertise, I will scrutinize the books and challenge the legislature to exercise greater caution in tax and spending decisions. As a CPA, I have dedicated my career to helping clients preserve their bottom lines, reduce taxes, and securing their futures. I developed and taught a financial literacy class to junior high students and testified before the legislature against raising taxes and over-regulating our businesses. My experience includes advising taxpayers and businesses in our community on wise investments and job creation. In an era of job uncertainty, rising prices, and constant demands for education funding, Olympia’s typical solution is to raise taxes and fees. My approach is to account for past expenditures and prioritize sensibly. I will be the accountant Treasurer who leads our state into a new era of fiscal responsibility. Vote to preserve our fiscal future. Vote for accountability. Vote for Sharon Hanek.",

Judge Larson knows Washington has the best state Constitution in America, offering stronger protections for our civil rights than the U. S. Constitution. He will protect individual rights. We all know crime is a serious issue and Judge Larson has a nearly two decade record of keeping us safe from crime as a trial judge. His innovative reforms have been recognized nationwide; many of his ideas have been adopted by our legislature. These reforms are supported by other judges, police chiefs and sheriffs, mayors, legislators, and the people who work directly with those suffering from addiction and untreated mental illness. Judge Larson is the only candidate running a campaign that reaches out to Democrats and Republicans, Labor and Business, Eastern and Western Washington, and everyday citizens. We can return to a less political and more trusted court system by voting for Judge Larson. Judge Larson’s leadership, innovations, intellect, ethics, and commitment to fairness make him exactly what we need on our state Supreme Court.",

Since 2021, I’ve safeguarded the integrity of our elections by investing in cyber and physical security, fighting malicious election disinformation, and providing eligible voters every ability to participate in our democratic process. I will protect Washington’s proven and dependable vote-by-mail system. I fought to expand automatic voter registration and increase civic engagement, lowering barriers for eligible citizens. Overseeing Washington’s State Library, I confronted book bans and censorship in public libraries across our state. I’ve increased access to business services and secured resources to preserve our state’s history. I’m endorsed by County Auditors who conduct elections, the Washington State Labor Council, business leaders, voting rights advocates, prominent state and federal leaders, and former Governors Gary Locke and Christine Gregoire. I am proud of my career in public service working alongside Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Washington’s Secretary of State must possess the highest standards of integrity and leadership and serve as a strong advocate for voter access. It is the privilege of my life to serve as your Secretary of State, and I would be honored to earn your vote.",

We must instill confidence in the electorate that our elections process and infrastructure are accessible, transparent, and secure. This includes giving the public a closer look inside our elections process and bringing back in person voting in addition to our mail-in voting. The Secretary of State’s office also has an important duty to the incredible businesses throughout Washington in making sure the government red tape does not impede on entrepreneurs ability to create and run their businesses in the state. When I am elected Secretary of State I will work with the Governor and State House to make Washington the most business friendly state in the country. I have lived in Spokane since 2008 when I emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States. My wife and I both run small businesses in Spokane, we have two children and a grandchild, we have established our roots here, and we truly love the beauty we have here in Washington State.",

The most important part of being Lieutenant Governor is serving as President of the State Senate and presiding in an impartial way, fairly applying the rules to everyone and to both parties. We have done this. But the office of Lieutenant Governor also affords the opportunity to advocate for important policy priorities. We have advocated long, consistently and clearly for the need to more forcefully address the housing crisis in our state, especially for affordable homes for low and moderate income families. Our work helped lead to many accomplishments last year, causing the 2023 session to be called The Year of Housing. So much work remains to be done. We will stay at it. We have also worked hard and in a bipartisan way, to improve our civic health. We all know it needs to change. We need more respectful discourse in the public square, more inclination to try to find principled compromises and when we cannot, a greater ability to disagree better. Here, too, we will doggedly stay at it. In this spirit, I humbly ask for your support.",

This job requires experience and tested leadership to maintain our post-pandemic recovery. Our strong learning acceleration is at risk without sustained funding and a relentless focus on keeping our schools public and accountable to local voters. The paramount duty in our state is to fully fund our public schools. Investing in our public schools and our educators to empower student achievement is my number one priority! Innovation drives our work with expanded career and technical education pathways, a record high graduation rate, a measurable improvement in student mental health following targeted investments, and free school meals for over 700,000 students. We are a top performing state in math and reading, and civics is once again a graduation requirement under my leadership! Over two-thirds of our students now earn college credit while in high school, saving families over $100 million per year in foregone tuition, and we've doubled our investments in rural school facilities. Every child deserves a high-quality, individualized, and equitable learning opportunity in every community!

OSPI is not fulfilling their duty to advocate for adequate school operational funding. As Superintendent, I will push to change the approach, ensuring resources reach the schools and students who need them most – regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Under the incumbent, chronic absenteeism has doubled, depriving children of crucial learning opportunities. Drawing from my district's success, where strong parental engagement has led to one of the state's lowest absentee rates, I will advocate for policies that encourage partnering with parents. I am committed to restoring local control to school boards, empowering those who understand their communities’ unique needs, ensuring a fair and effective education for all. I will push to expand skilled trades programs , preparing our students for future diverse careers. To combat the distractions of the digital age, I will promote policies restricting cell phones and social media in schools, creating safer, more focused learning environments. The Seattle Times stated the Superintendent is a “cheerleader for mediocrity. ” Average Is Not Good Enough! It is time for change. I'll appreciate your vote.",

Nick went to Morehouse College on an ROTC scholarship and after Harvard Law School, served as an Army JAG officer and federal prosecutor. As General Counsel to Governor Inslee, Nick oversaw work to end the death penalty and coordinated the administration’s response to Donald Trump’s hateful Muslim ban. In 2021 President Biden appointed Nick as the first Black U. S. Attorney in state history. There, Nick prioritized addressing the fentanyl crisis, protecting consumers, cracking down on sex trafficking, and combatting violent crime. As Attorney General, Nick will work to keep all Washingtonians safe – from crime, gun violence, discrimination, and the growing housing crisis. Nick believes Donald Trump poses an unprecedented threat to our country and will fight to protect our state from attacks on civil liberties. Nick believes the decision to have an abortion should be between a woman, her family, and doctor. He will fight any attempt to take away reproductive rights. Nick is proudly endorsed by Governor Inslee, the Washington Education Association, Washington Conservation Action, and Washington State Labor Council.",

The highest violent crime rate in our history, friends and family dying from fentanyl, record homelessness, and the worst maintained roads, highways, and ferries in America. As your governor, I will work tirelessly to foster an economy that works for everyone, safe streets and neighborhoods, and ensure the children in our state get a world class education. From the United States Air Force to the King County Sheriff’s Office, I witnessed examples of selfless sacrifice, individuals who put others before themselves. That experience taught me what it means to have a servant’s heart, honored by an opportunity to help, and driven to show the courage and humility it takes to get things done. As King County Sheriff, I arrested violent criminals and locked up human traffickers who preyed on women and children. On my watch crime was down as we enforced the law and everyone was accountable. This experience served me well when the people of Washington sent me to Congress where I worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass big and bold policies on everything from taxes to trade to protecting our beautiful environment. We’ve been living in a state where our leaders have pit region against region, generation against generation, and yes even family against family. Dividing people is not the answer. We must work together, side by side, to tackle the issues we all face. I have been endorsed by nearly every sheriff in the state and people of all party affiliations – Republican, Independent, Democrat – are joining our campaign because they understand that business as usual is no longer an option. I would be honored to have your support to be your next governor.",

Over my eight-year tenure, responsibilities have expanded, including significant audits of federal COVID-19 pandemic funds. My administration has also greatly reduced the number of \"unauditable\" governments, increasing our audits' scope and effectiveness. Under my leadership, we exposed nearly $7 million in misappropriated funds at a local housing agency, the largest fraud case in our state's history. We have strengthened our capabilities by training more fraud examiners and launching innovative programs. These include a pioneering audit of law enforcement's use of deadly force, bolstering cybersecurity with increased IT audits and preventive \"cyber-checkups,\" and a new data analytics program to detect fraud and waste more effectively. I will continue these efforts in my next term, focusing on managing public resources wisely. My vision includes advancing our technological capabilities to protect public assets and promote integrity across Washington State. Many have endorsed me; details are on my website. I have a proven and tested public record of leadership. I humbly ask for your vote to continue our progress.",

Solutions to our challenges with education, the homeless, mental health, parental rights, property rights, taxes and energy policy can all be found through transparency in audits. Observing the divide within our country over the past 4 years, Hawkins began asking questions to learn what is happening. An active study of the election system within Washington during this time has revealed the fact that there have been no Audits of the election systems in Washington State, to the same professional standards as are expected in the private sector. Hawkins further learned of the newly created roadblocks to public transparency, as the public is looking for answers. Taxpayers benefit from transparency and accountability. A search for Truth matters.",

I’ll continue championing issues that are dear to my heart and represent our shared Democratic values: reducing homelessness, investing in affordable housing, expanding behavioral and mental health services, protecting abortion access, and tackling climate change. This last session we made great progress on these issues while also improving public safety, addressing the fentanyl crisis, and reducing gun violence. We have more work to do to expand accessible and affordable housing, ensure equitable access to public education, create a sustainable transportation system, uphold LGBTQ civil rights, and reduce carbon emissions further.",

I’m running to unite Seattle so we can make real progress on housing affordability and public safety, while protecting worker rights and advancing climate action. Because of my commitment to positive change– and experience advancing budget and policy solutions– I’ve earned the sole endorsement of every Seattle-based Democratic Party organization and the MLK Labor Council. While I approach policy rooted in data and measurable outcomes, I am equally informed by personal experience. Born to teenagers caught up in gang violence and cycles of substance use and homelessness, I was able to reach my potential thanks to loving grandparents, great teachers, and afternoons at the Boys & Girls Club. My family’s struggles –from substance abuse to housing insecurity– mirror many of the challenges we face in Seattle. We can break these cycles by building coalitions across ideological lines, to finally deliver on affordable and supportive housing, invest in public safety that works, and ensure everyone has the opportunity to thrive. With your vote, I’ll work collaboratively, addressing our challenges with proven solutions and personal understanding Public safety policies that reduce crime and harm, prevent gun violence, and improve staffing and response; Affordable housing so that seniors, hardworking families, and renters like myself can live in the city we love and build generational wealth. Climate action including fast and reliable transit, more sidewalks, and green infrastructure. Progressive revenue solutions to balance our budget– preserving essential services and promoting healthy neighborhoods. In addition to Democratic groups I’m endorsed by Executive Dow Constantine; County Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda; City Councilmember Tammy Morales; Senators Saldaña & Frame; Representatives Macri, Reed, Alvarado & Farivar; UAW 4121, UFCW 3000, SEIU 1199NW & more! I’m proudly the only Alliance for Gun Responsibility “Approved” candidate in this race.",

My work on the City Council is driven by a simple truth: we cannot thrive unless we lift each other up. I believe in a city where safety, opportunity, and justice are not just aspirations, but realities. My vision is to build a Seattle that is resilient, compassionate, and inclusive—a place where every resident, from our youngest to our most vulnerable, can live with dignity and hope. On too many fronts, Seattle is struggling. On housing affordability and public safety, we’re still seeing the impact of failed past policies. We need a City Council that isn’t afraid to do the work. As a community leader, I’ve organized safety teams that provide mutual aid and connect our unhoused neighbors to essential services. I’ve administered Narcan and CPR; I’ve held people who didn’t survive their overdose. I’ll ensure a balanced approach that invests in community programs, first responders, and alternatives that collaborate with city agencies as we fight gun violence. I’ve built affordable housing and, on Council, I’m working to build more affordable, supportive housing, filling in critical gaps. I will push for more behavioral health specialists on the streets through an expanded CARE team. It’s also time to change laws restricting outreach to those in crisis. We shouldn’t wait for a police incident to provide a helping hand. We need leaders who aren’t afraid to walk the streets of Seattle – leaders who stand with our community in tough times, who listen, and who will fight for you. Together, let’s build a safe Seattle that uplifts and empowers everyone!
