For most people, their initial encounter with the Washington state judicial system is confusing and frightening. By allowing everyone to be heard with fairness and consideration a judge can reduce these anxieties. Regardless of position or status, everyone in the justice system should feel welcome and given even consideration in the courtroom.

Everyday technologies are shunned and paper filings are still required. More importantly, too many dangerous people escape accountability for their actions, and too many people are behind bars, who could, with effective supervision and programs, return to positive and productive lives. With the goal of modernizing and restoring balance to superior court, Andrew stands out as a beacon of ingenuity and integrity. As a prosecutor, Andrew streamlined processes and embraced new technologies. He earned a reputation for holding people accountable for their actions and a reputation for fairness and compassion by helping create a felony drug court from the ground up. Now as a pro tem and as a staff attorney for the Court of Appeals, Andrew has established a reputation for impartiality and professionalism by treating all people with respect and dignity, while upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. Andrew has received excellent judicial candidate ratings from several independent bar associations. His endorsements include bipartisan support from community leaders, the Spokane Police Guild, and judges at all court levels, including on Washington\u2019s Supreme Court.",

With more than 33 years in private practice prior to my first election, I bring practical experience and sound judgment to the myriad decisions required of a Judge. Presiding over cases involving criminal charges, diverse civil claims and family law matters has deepened that experience, sharpened my decision making, and furthered my respect for the legal process. Being a judge requires active listening, legal acumen and a devotion to fairness. Superior Court cases involve all manner of disputes, and parties under extreme stress, where determinations result in lasting outcomes. Our legal system provides the framework for resolutions that are fair and without bias. My experiences allow me to make competent, yet compassionate decisions in line with that framework. Justice depends on consistent application of the rights provided to all under the law. As an incumbent Superior Court Judge, I seek the opportunity to continue to strengthen our local judiciary and pledge to work to find justice for all matters before me. Please vote Fennessy, Department 11 and let me continue in service to you and Spokane County.",

Before joining the bench, I prosecuted people for sex crimes committed against children and adults, represented Child Protective Services, and litigated civil rights, torts, and collection cases. Safe Communities Matter. As the father of three children, I understand the importance of keeping our communities safe by holding people accountable for their actions, encouraging treatment options, and supporting at-risk youth to strive for a better future. Partnerships Matter. We need a team approach to keep our communities safe and provide services to those in need. Throughout my career, I have built strong working relationships with law enforcement officers, social workers, correctional officers, and treatment providers. Ratings Matter.

Unfortunately, our city\u2019s policies have gone counter to this tradition, opting for inhumane and cruel bandages to the social and economic problems we are facing. I grew up in New Holly, a Seattle Housing Authority project. My family and I relied heavily on programs from public health clinics and food stamps to Running Start and college grants to survive. My story is a testament to how we can uplift everyone by promising safety and security to everyone. We currently have a council majority that puts the priorities of the wealthy ahead of the rest of us, and we need a citywide leader that will stand up to corporate influence and put the people first. We need a bolder representative who is not scared to stand up to these entities and fight for the best interest of all of our residents. I\u2019ve dedicated my career to protecting our privacy; keeping Big Tech accountable to the social and community impacts that their inventions have. I\u2019ve spent my entire life among the Seattle community amplifying the political voice and power of refugees and volunteering with programs that connect us together. My professional and personal track record outlines my dedication to speaking truth to power and unapologetically addressing the challenges that face us. I\u2019m not running for office for power or authority, I\u2019m running because I\u2019m tired of seeing our city force out people who lack the money or power to stay here. Seeing my friends and family suffer while knowing I was able to do something is something I can no longer tolerate. I have pledged to leave this city better than I found it. I hope you will join me in making a Seattle built for everyone.",

With your vote, I\u2019ll bring bold leadership and a generational voice to City Council to champion equitable investments in our priorities, community-driven solutions, and a brighter future for the next generation. While I approach policy rooted in data and measurable outcomes, I am equally informed by personal experience. Born to teenagers caught up in gang violence and cycles of substance use, homelessness, and incarceration, I was able to break those cycles thanks to loving grandparents, educational mentors, and afternoons at the Boys & Girls Club. My family\u2019s struggles mirror many of the challenges we face in Seattle, but we can break these cycles by providing affordable and supportive housing, supporting safe and healthy communities, and ensuring that no child is limited from reaching their full potential. On the Council, I\u2019ll work collaboratively to address Seattle\u2019s challenges with proven solutions and personal understanding: Public safety resources targeted to reducing crime and harm, including law enforcement and alternative staffing, proven community interventions, and gun violence prevention. Affordable housing at every level so seniors, working families, and renters like myself can remain in the city and build generational wealth. Climate action without compromise, including transit and electrification, more sidewalks, and green infrastructure. Progressive revenue solutions to a budget deficit that must maintain core services and support healthy outcomes. I\u2019m proudly endorsed by unions, diverse community voices, and elected leaders who know my work and commitment to positive change: 36th, 46th & King County Democrats; State Senators Rebecca Salda\u00f1a & Noel Frame; State Representatives Nicole Macri & Julia Reed; Councilmember Tammy Morales; Sage Leaders; UFCW 3000; essential workers; & more!",

I grew up on Beacon Hill, working at my family\u2019s business in the Chinatown/International District. Today, I live in Rainier Beach, and operate a neighborhood restaurant and affordable housing complex. As a community advocate, I\u2019ve confronted our toughest citywide issues, from public safety to combating racism and gentrification. Progress in Seattle demands leaders who are hardworking, collaborative, and action-oriented. When neighborhoods faced rising crime, I organized community safety teams. Seeing too many friends and neighbors priced out, I worked to convert the historic Louisa Hotel into workforce housing, where tenants pay based on what they can afford. I\u2019ve done everything from championing government accountability, to administering Narcan and CPR to unsheltered neighbors in crisis. I believe Seattle is at a crossroads. For too long, regional leaders have doubled down on failed approaches to issues like homelessness and public safety. These broken promises hurt the marginalized most. Seattle can move mountains on these issues! We can lead the nation in protecting the vulnerable. However, it will take leadership willing to prioritize what really works. As your citywide Councilmember, I\u2019m most focused on three challenges: Public Safety , Homelessness , and Affordability. To keep Seattle safe, I\u2019ll work to fully staff our first responders while supporting commonsense reforms. I will fight to improve the effectiveness of services for the unsheltered. And, to address the rising cost of living, I will bring my experience developing low-income housing to foster more affordable housing across Seattle. Seattle is a compassionate city. Neighbors take care of neighbors, especially the vulnerable. As your citywide Councilmember, I work for the City Council Seattle deserves\u2014one that focuses on what matters most and, above all, delivers compassionate results. I\u2019m Tanya Woo, and I ask for your vote.",

It takes a village! I've always had a passion for public infrastructure and urban planning, sparked by my experience living in public housing and relying on King County Metro. I\u2019m proudly endorsed by the Transit Riders Union where I co-founded the Bus and Transit Services Workgroup and served as Treasurer. I've collaborated with diverse groups of neighbors, including businesses, to expand bike and transit infrastructure alongside Cascade Bicycle Club, advocated for an Office of Renter Standards through the Seattle Renter Organizing Council, and stood for democracy serving on the board of the League of Women Voters\u2013SKC. When considering legislation, I ask: \u201c What\u2019s the goal? Who benefits? Who\u2019s harmed? \u201d I support I-137 to fund social housing, updating zoning laws to create more homes for families, and partnering with housing providers to enact right-to-shelter agreements. I\u2019m a Teamster in Local 117, and I plan to facilitate apprenticeship programs like those I\u2019m developing as a Board Member of Community Roots Housing. We must confront the $200 million budget deficit, without sacrificing Seattleite welfare, through progressive revenue streams like protecting and expanding Jumpstart and enacting new revenue like a Seattle Capital Gains tax. I'll focus on public services, like 24/7/365 restrooms in parks, so everyone can enjoy the city\u2019s culture through safe and accessible public spaces. I want Seattle to become the livable city we know it can be. On City Council, I will bring collaborative, detail-oriented thinking to bridge department silos in creating an equitable and accessible Seattle for all. If this is the Seattle you want to help create, then I humbly ask for your vote.",

Growing up in Seattle has given me a deep understanding of our city's unique challenges and opportunities. Seattle needs leaders who understand the diverse needs of its residents and can implement effective solutions - Over the past 20 years, I have dedicated my career to developing high-performing people and teams across various sectors including business, education, sports, social services, and spiritual growth. I have led innovative programs such as the Workforce Development Program for youth and young adults, developed a text app process for the Dept of Human Services in Oregon and managed a $200 million channel business for Veritas Technology. From tackling homelessness to improving our public education system and fostering economic growth through small businesses\u2014my background allows me to understand these challenges deeply and work towards practical solutions. Seattle needs leaders who understand resilience and dedication - My journey began as a college athlete, manifesting a remarkable skill set that I developed in trust, confidence, and connection based on relationships. If you bless me with the opportunity to serve as your Seattle City Councilman, your support would be the intrinsic drive and motivation that fuels me, not the accolades. I will show up when circumstances are tough and work tirelessly for our community\u2019s betterment. My commitment, work ethic and tenacity are bar none, bringing the same resilience and dedication if elected Seattle City Councilman.",
